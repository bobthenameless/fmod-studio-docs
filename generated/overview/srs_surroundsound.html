<b><u>1. About SRS 5.1 Surround Sound Encoder</b></u><br>
<br>
The SRS 5.1 Surround Sound Encoder for FMOD features SRS’ advanced matrix surround sound processing engine. The SRS surround engine is a highly versatile multichannel audio encode system capable of supporting a wide range of surround sound creation and playback applications. With SRS 5.1 Surround Sound, surround sound is made available without sacrificing the 2-channel reach and experience.<br>
<br>
<b><u>2. Overview of SRS 5.1 Surround Sound</b></u><br>
<br>
SRS 5.1 Surround Sound Encoder provides the capability to encode up to 6.1 channels of audio for transmission or storage over two output channels or standard two-channel carriers. SRS 5.1 Surround Sound Encoder can be listened to in stereo or decoded TVs, PCs, receivers, mobile phones and other CE devices with SRS technologies. SRS 5.1 Surround Sound is also backward compatible with all matrix decoders, such as Dolby Pro Logic® and Dolby Pro Logic Il®, with playback performance subject to the limitations of the specific decoder.<br>
