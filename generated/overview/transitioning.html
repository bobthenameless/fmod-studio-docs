<h1>Transitioning between FMOD Ex and FMOD Studio</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This section describes the differences between FMOD Ex and FMOD Studio.</p>

<h2>FMOD Studio API Versus FMOD Designer API</h2>

<p>The FMOD Studio API is conceptually similar to the old FMOD Designer API, but most classes have been renamed, and some
have been removed or split up.</p>

<h3>EventSystem and EventSystem_Create</h3>

<p>The Studio::System class is analogous to the old EventSystem class. The static <A HREF="../FMOD_Studio_System_Create.html">Studio::System::create</A> function is
analogous to the old EventSystem_Create function.</p>

<h3>EventProject</h3>

<p>The Studio::Bank class is analogous to the old EventProject class.</p>

<h3>FEV and FSB Files</h3>

<p>Each FMOD Designer project produced a single .fev file and multiple .fsb files.
In contrast, an FMOD Studio project produces multiple .bank files, which contain event metadata as well as sample data.
See the <A HREF="../FMOD_Studio_System_LoadBankFile.html">Studio::System::loadBankFile</A>, <A HREF="../FMOD_Studio_Bank_LoadSampleData.html">Studio::Bank::loadSampleData</A>, and <A HREF="../FMOD_Studio_EventDescription_LoadSampleData.html">Studio::EventDescription::loadSampleData</A>
functions. The low level API still supports loading .fsb files directly.</p>

<h3>EventGroup</h3>

<p>FMOD Studio doesn't have the concept of EventGroups. Events can be placed in folders, but this has no significance at
runtime. To achieve the loading control formerly provided by EventGroups, events can be placed in different banks.</p>

<h3>Event</h3>

<p>The old Event class has been split into two classes: Studio::EventDescription and Studio::EventInstance.
Studio::EventDescription holds the static data that describes an event, while Studio::EventInstance is a playable
instance of an event. These two classes correspond to old Event objects retrieved by calling getEvent with or without
the FMOD_EVENT_INFOONLY flag.</p>

<p>The FMOD Designer API used to create a fixed number of event instances when you first called getEvent without
FMOD_EVENT_INFOONLY, whereas the FMOD Studio API creates a single instance each time you call
EventDescription::createInstance. This gives you more control over the memory usage for each event.</p>

<h3>Retrieving Events</h3>

<p>Events are now retrieved by ID rather than by path. IDs can be parsed from a string using <A HREF="../FMOD_Studio_ParseID.html">Studio::parseID</A>, or looked up
from a path using <A HREF="../FMOD_Studio_System_LookupID.html">Studio::System::lookupID</A> if the "Master Bank.strings.bank" file is loaded.</p>

<h3>EventParameter</h3>

<p>The Studio::ParameterInstance class is analogous to the old EventParameter class.</p>

<h3>Sustain Points and Key Off</h3>

<p>The old EventParameter class had a keyOff function to move past the next sustain point. In FMOD Studio this behaviour is
implemented via a built-in KeyOff cue that can be retrieved from the event via <A HREF="../FMOD_Studio_EventInstance_GetCue.html">Studio::EventInstance::getCue</A> and
triggered by calling <A HREF="../FMOD_Studio_CueInstance_Trigger.html">Studio::CueInstance::trigger</A>.</p>

<h3>EventCategory</h3>

<p>Event categories have been replaced in FMOD Studio by buses and VCAs, which provide much more functionality to the sound
designer. At runtime, buses and VCAs are accessed via the Studio::MixerStrip class.</p>

<h3>EventReverb</h3>

<p>The EventReverb class has been removed. Similar functionality can be implemented using events with automatic distance
parameters controlling reverb snapshots.</p>

<h3>EventQueue and EventQueueEntry</h3>

<p>FMOD Studio doesn't have the concept of event queues.</p>

<h3>MusicSystem and MusicPrompt</h3>

<p>Interactive music in FMOD Studio is implemented inside the event editor, so the MusicSystem and MusicPrompt classes have
been removed.</p>

<h3>NetEventSystem</h3>

<p>Whereas the old network tweaking API was implemented as a separate fmod_event_net library, the FMOD Studio live update
system is built into the main API library, and can be enabled by passing <A HREF="../FMOD_STUDIO_INITFLAGS.html">FMOD_STUDIO_INIT_LIVEUPDATE</A> to
Studio::System::init.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/></p>

<h2>FMOD Studio Low Level API Versus FMOD Ex Low Level API</h2>

<h3><A HREF="../FMOD_MODE.html">FMOD_HARDWARE</A> support</h3>

<p>FMOD Studio is such an advanced mixing engine, that the limited features of hardware voices could not possibly hope to
achieve parity with the features of FMOD's software engine. It has been decided that in this day and age of multicore 
processors, even at the mobile level, that hardware voice support gained nothing for the user. FMOD's software engine 
can actually be faster, and better quality, and more flexible than hardware, so all sounds and voices are software mixed 
now.
API changes:<br/></p>

<ul>
<li>System::setHardwareChannels is removed</li>
<li>System::getDriverCaps is removed.  systemrate, speakermode, speakermodechannels parameters have been added to 
<A HREF="../FMOD_System_GetDriverInfo.html">System::getDriverInfo</A> to provide the information which may be important to the developer.  Similarly, 
System::getgetRecordDriverCaps has been removed, in favour of <A HREF="../FMOD_System_GetRecordDriverInfo.html">System::getRecordDriverInfo</A>.</li>
<li>System::setSpeakerMode and System::getSpeakerMode are removed, and instead are now moved into <A HREF="../FMOD_System_SetSoftwareFormat.html">System::setSoftwareFormat</A>
because 'speakermode' now only affects the internal mixer, and the operating system speaker mode is matched at runtime
through matrix upmixing or downmixing (automatically).</li>
</ul>

<h3>FMOD Ex had Channels and ChannelGroups, now it seems they are merged into 'ChannelControl'?</h3>

<p>Channels and ChannelGroups had some similar functionality in FMOD Ex (ie setVolume, setPaused), but FMOD Studio takes
it even further. FMOD Studio has been designed so that ChannelGroups can have a lot more control, like pausing and
muting at the DSP node level, adding effects, and positioning in 3d.</p>

<h3>No more 'recommended startup sequence'</h3>

<p>FMOD Studio now handles the speaker mode automatically.  To start FMOD Studio is as simple as calling <A HREF="../FMOD_System_Init.html">System::init</A>, 
rather than querying caps or speaker modes to make FMOD's software mixer match that of the operating system.<br/>
If you want the software mixer to be forced into a certain speaker mode, disregarding the operating system, use 
<A HREF="../FMOD_System_SetSoftwareFormat.html">System::setSoftwareFormat</A>. FMOD will automatically downmix or upmix this mode if the user's system is not the
same speaker mode as the one selected for the software engine. Where possible, SRS, Dolby or internal downmixing will be 
used to achieve better surround effect.</p>

<h3>Converting FMOD Reverb parameters</h3>

<p>Reverb parameters have changed in FMOD Studio. See the <a href="../overview/reverbnotes.html">Reverb notes</a> section for more
information.</p>

<h3>'W' function wide char support</h3>

<p>Functions such as System::getDriverInfoW have been removed in favour of UTF8 support.</p>

<h3>Added <A HREF="../FMOD_System_GetDSPInfoByPlugin.html">System::getDSPInfoByPlugin</A></h3>

<p>This function has been added to plug the gap between loading a plugin, and getting its <A HREF="../FMOD_DSP_DESCRIPTION.html">FMOD_DSP_DESCRIPTION</A> structure so
that it can be passed to <A HREF="../FMOD_System_CreateDSP.html">System::createDSP</A>.</p>

<h3>System::set3DSpeakerPosition is now called <A HREF="../FMOD_System_SetSpeakerPosition.html">System::setSpeakerPosition</A></h3>

<p>Minor name change to denote that 3d and 2d positioning is affected by speaker location.</p>

<h3><A HREF="../FMOD_System_MixerSuspend.html">System::mixerSuspend</A> and <A HREF="../FMOD_System_MixerResume.html">System::mixerResume</A> added</h3>

<p>For mobile devices, these functions allow you to halt FMOD's cpu mixer and thread before sleeping or answering a call or
any other interruption event.</p>

<h3>FMOD_CHANNEL_FREE / FMOD_CHANNEL_REUSE removed.  Default ChannelGroup now passed to playSound if needed</h3>

<p><A HREF="../FMOD_System_PlaySound.html">System::playSound</A> and <A HREF="../FMOD_System_PlayDSP.html">System::playDSP</A> now do not take a 'channel' parameter.  All channels behave the same way as 
FMOD_CHANNEL_FREE would have in FMOD Ex.<br/>
Seeing as a parameter was removed from playSound/playDSP, a new one was added to remove the overhead of disconnecting 
and reconnecting DSP graph nodes after playSound was called, so that they could be hooked up to a new ChannelGroup other
than the master ChannelGroup.   Consider this addition a performance optimization, and a simplification in API calls.</p>

<h3>CDROM / CDDA support removed</h3>

<p>Legacy support for CDROM redbook audio playback has been removed due to lack of interest and issues with maintaining 
said code.</p>

<h3>System::getSpectrum and System::getWaveData removed</h3>

<p>Add a custom DSP unit to capture DSP wavedata from the output stage.  Use the master channelgroup's DSP head with
<A HREF="../FMOD_System_GetMasterChannelGroup.html">System::getMasterChannelGroup</A> and <A HREF="../FMOD_ChannelControl_GetDSP.html">ChannelControl::getDSP</A>.<br/>
Add a built in FFT DSP unit type to capture spectrum data from the output stage.  Create a built in FFT unit with 
<A HREF="../FMOD_System_CreateDSPByType.html">System::createDSPByType</A> and <A HREF="../FMOD_DSP_TYPE.html">FMOD_DSP_TYPE_FFT</A>, then add the effect to the master ChannelGroup with <A HREF="../FMOD_ChannelGroup_AddDSP.html">ChannelGroup::addDSP</A>.
Use <A HREF="../FMOD_DSP_GetParameterData.html">DSP::getParameterData</A> to get the raw spectrum data or use <A HREF="../FMOD_DSP_GetParameterFloat.html">DSP::getParameterFloat</A> to get the dominant frequency from
the signal.</p>

<h3><A HREF="../FMOD_System_AttachChannelGroupToPort.html">System::attachChannelGroupToPort</A> and <A HREF="../FMOD_System_DetachChannelGroupFromPort.html">System::detachChannelGroupFromPort</A></h3>

<p>This new feature allows signals to be sent to alternate sound outputs like headsets, controllers with speakers, 
and console based multi speaker arrays that are not the standard surround sound speaker output.</p>

<h3>System::setReverbAmbientProperties removed</h3>

<p>The 'background' ambient reverb for a 3d reverb system is now just the standard reverb set with 
<A HREF="../FMOD_System_SetReverbProperties.html">System::setReverbProperties</A>.</p>

<h3>System::getDSPClock removed</h3>

<p>Use the DSP clock of the master ChannelGroup instead with <A HREF="../FMOD_System_GetMasterChannelGroup.html">System::getMasterChannelGroup</A> and <A HREF="../FMOD_ChannelGroup_GetDSPClock.html">ChannelGroup::getDSPClock</A></p>

<h3>getMemoryInfo functions have been removed from all classes</h3>

<p>Due to the unreliability of the function in FMOD Ex due to caching, threads, and shared memory throwing results out, 
the function has been removed.  Alternate memory tracking methods will be added later.  FMOD::Memory_GetStats and 
logging is the best way to track memory at the moment.</p>

<h3>Sound::setVariations and Sound::getVariations have been removed</h3>

<p>Due to this being a 'helper' function that can easily be acheived in user code, this was deemed not necessary and 
removed.</p>

<h3>Sound::setSubSoundSentence has been removed</h3>

<p>This function has been removed in favour of the extremely precise and more reliable <A HREF="../FMOD_ChannelControl_SetDelay.html">ChannelControl::setDelay</A> 
functionality.  2 or more sounds can be queued up to play end to end using this function, with the added benefit of 
cross fades and overlaps.</p>

<h3><A HREF="../FMOD_Sound_GetSubSoundParent.html">Sound::getSubSoundParent</A> has been added</h3>

<p>Added the ability for a child sound (subsound) to query for its parent.</p>

<h3><A HREF="../FMOD_ChannelControl_SetVolumeRamp.html">ChannelControl::setVolumeRamp</A>/<A HREF="../FMOD_ChannelControl_GetVolumeRamp.html">ChannelControl::getVolumeRamp</A> has been added</h3>

<p>When queuing sounds up and for other reasons, it can be desirable to turn off ramping of volume changes, so the ability
has been added to turn volume ramping (declicking) off or on per channel/channelgroup.</p>

<h3>setDelay and clock functions now use 64bit 'long long' type rather than than 32bit hi and 32bit low part parameters.</h3>

<p>Due to the complexity of working in fixed point, and seeing as there is a consistent 64bit type for all compilers in long 
long that FMOD supports, we have switched to this type.<br/>
1 32bit value would wrap around in 24 hours at 48khz, so 64bit values will last for 12 million years which should be enough to avoid in game clock wrap around.</p>

<h3>Channel::setSpeakerMix, Channel::setSpeakerLevels, Channel::setInputChannelMix, Channel::getPan, Channel::getSpeakerMix and Channel::getSpeakerLevels removed</h3>

<p>A cleaner replacement has been made for these functions,<br/></p>

<ul>
<li><A HREF="../FMOD_ChannelControl_SetMixLevelsOutput.html">ChannelControl::setMixLevelsOutput</A>     (float frontleft, float frontright, float center, float lfe, float surroundleft, float surroundright, float backleft, float backright);</li>
<li><A HREF="../FMOD_ChannelControl_SetMixLevelsInput.html">ChannelControl::setMixLevelsInput</A>      (float *levels, int numlevels);</li>
<li><A HREF="../FMOD_ChannelControl_SetMixMatrix.html">ChannelControl::setMixMatrix</A>           (float *matrix, int outchannels, int inchannels, int inchannel_hop = 0);</li>
<li><A HREF="../FMOD_ChannelControl_GetMixMatrix.html">ChannelControl::getMixMatrix</A>           (float *matrix, int *outchannels, int *inchannels, int inchannel_hop = 0);</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that because setPan, setMixLevelsOutput and setMixLevelsInput all affect a final pan matrix, only getMixMatrix 
is available as the 'getter'.  There is no more exclusive mode for the panning technique like there was in FMOD Ex.<br/>
All 3 functions can now affect the final matrix.  The setMixMatrix function now allows instant setting of a full matrix
for performance reasons, rather than calling setSpeakerLevels each time for each speaker.</p>

<h3>Channel::set3DPanLevel misnomer renamed to <A HREF="../FMOD_ChannelControl_Set3DLevel.html">ChannelControl::set3DLevel</A></h3>

<p>The FMOD Ex function did not actually only affect pan, it also affected doppler and distance attentuation so to call 
it 'pan' level was not really correct.  FMOD Studio corrects this.</p>

<h3><A HREF="../FMOD_ChannelControl_AddFadePoint.html">ChannelControl::addFadePoint</A>, <A HREF="../FMOD_ChannelControl_RemoveFadePoints.html">ChannelControl::removeFadePoints</A> and <A HREF="../FMOD_ChannelControl_GetFadePoints.html">ChannelControl::getFadePoints</A> added</h3>

<p>Now the ability to set up a volume fade or ramp between any 2 clock points is possible.  Link up multiple fade points to create envelopes.
All fading is clock accurate and compensated for when pitch is changed.</p>

<h3>'override' functions removed from ChannelGroup class</h3>

<p>Because volume/pitch/muting/reverb properties and pausing has been added as a ChannelGroup concept at the DSP level,
ChannelGroups no longer rely on their 'channels' to do pausing and muting type logic.  The ChannelGroup's DSP itself will
directly mute/pause etc, thanks to the removal of <A HREF="../FMOD_MODE.html">FMOD_HARDWARE</A> support.</p>

<h3>Concept of a 'fader' and 'panner' added per ChannelGroup</h3>

<p>Each ChannelGroup has a built in 'fader' and 'panner'.  A fader adjusts volume of the signal for a submix, and also 
supports sample accurate volume fade points, for envelopes and fade ins / fade outs.<br/>
A panner is a separate entity which can pan a sound in mono, stereo and surround using a variety of parameters including 
position/direction/extent/rotation/axis control and 3d position control.<br/>
The order of processing of a fader and panner can be controlled using <A HREF="../FMOD_ChannelGroup_SetDSPIndex.html">ChannelGroup::setDSPIndex</A>, and it can be positioned
into an effect chain so that panning comes before an effect or after, with fading coming at a different position in the
effect chain.</p>

<h3>DSP::remove removed from the DSP API</h3>

<p>Effects that are added with <A HREF="../FMOD_ChannelControl_AddDSP.html">ChannelControl::addDSP</A> are owned by the ChannelControl that added it, and therefore must be 
removed with <A HREF="../FMOD_ChannelControl_RemoveDSP.html">ChannelControl::removeDSP</A>, instead of having the DSP removing itself.  This helps the channelgroup or channel 
manage resources.</p>

<h3>New DSPConnection types supported</h3>

<p><A HREF="../FMOD_DSP_AddInput.html">DSP::addInput</A> now has a new optional parameter to describe the connection's behaviour between 2 DSP units.
<A HREF="../FMOD_DSPCONNECTION_TYPE.html">FMOD_DSPCONNECTION_TYPE</A> has been added to tell an input DSP that<br/></p>

<ul>
<li>It should mix to a 'sidechain' buffer, which is a special buffer for DSP units that want to process a sidechain 
(for example a compressor) through a DSP unit's <A HREF="../FMOD_DSP_STATE.html">FMOD_DSP_STATE</A> structure.  This signal is not audible but is used to 
affect behaviour within the DSP.  <A HREF="../FMOD_DSPCONNECTION_TYPE.html">FMOD_DSPCONNECTION_TYPE_SIDECHAIN</A> would be used here.</li>
<li>It should only consume existing data, not execute the input to generate that data.  <A HREF="../FMOD_DSPCONNECTION_TYPE.html">FMOD_DSPCONNECTION_TYPE_SEND</A> would
be used here.  This can be useful for graph dependency reasons, so that an input is not executed before it should be.</li>
</ul>

<h3>New DSP parameter types</h3>

<p>In FMOD Ex, only float parameters were supported.  Now Int, Bool and Data parameters are supported. <br>
Use:<br/></p>

<ul>
<li><A HREF="../FMOD_DSP_SetParameterFloat.html">DSP::setParameterFloat</A>, <A HREF="../FMOD_DSP_GetParameterFloat.html">DSP::getParameterFloat</A></li>
<li><A HREF="../FMOD_DSP_SetParameterInt.html">DSP::setParameterInt</A>, <A HREF="../FMOD_DSP_GetParameterInt.html">DSP::getParameterInt</A></li>
<li><A HREF="../FMOD_DSP_SetParameterBool.html">DSP::setParameterBool</A>, <A HREF="../FMOD_DSP_GetParameterBool.html">DSP::getParameterBool</A></li>
<li><A HREF="../FMOD_DSP_SetParameterData.html">DSP::setParameterData</A>, <A HREF="../FMOD_DSP_GetParameterData.html">DSP::getParameterData</A></li>
</ul>

<p><br/>
<br/>
<br/></p>
