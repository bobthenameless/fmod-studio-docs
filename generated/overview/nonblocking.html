<H1>Non-blocking sound creation</H1>

<H2>Introduction</H2>
FMOD_NONBLOCKING flag is used so that sounds can be loaded without affecting the framerate of the application.<br>
Normally loading operations can take a large or significant amount of time, but with this feature, sounds can be loaded in the background without the application skipping a beat.

<h2>Creating the sound.</h2>
Simply create the sound as you normally would but add the FMOD_NONBLOCKING flag.<br>
<PRE>
FMOD::Sound *sound;
result = system->createStream("../media/wave.mp3", FMOD_NONBLOCKING, 0, &sound); <b>// Creates a handle to a stream then commands the FMOD Async loader to open the stream in the background.</b>
ERRCHECK(result);
</PRE>

Now the sound will open in the background, and you will get a handle to the sound immediately.  You cannot do anything with this sound handle except call Sound::getOpenState.  Any other attempts to use this sound handle will result in the function returning FMOD_ERR_NOTREADY.

<h2>Getting a callback when the sound loads.</h2>
When the sound loads or the stream opens, you can specify a callback using the nonblockcallback member of the FMOD_CREATESOUNDEXINFO structure that is called when the operation is completed.<br>
Firstly the callback definition.<br>

<PRE>
FMOD_RESULT F_CALLBACK nonblockcallback(FMOD_SOUND *sound, FMOD_RESULT result)
{
    FMOD::Sound *snd = (FMOD::Sound *)sound;

    printf("Sound loaded! (%d) %s\n", result, FMOD_ErrorString(result)); 

    return FMOD_OK;
}
</PRE>

And then the createSound call.

<PRE>
FMOD_RESULT result;
FMOD::Sound *sound;
FMOD_CREATESOUNDEXINFO exinfo;

memset(&exinfo, 0, sizeof(FMOD_CREATESOUNDEXINFO));
exinfo.cbsize = sizeof(FMOD_CREATESOUNDEXINFO);
exinfo.nonblockcallback = nonblockcallback;

result = system->createStream("../media/wave.mp3", FMOD_NONBLOCKING, &exinfo, &sound);
ERRCHECK(result);
</PRE>

<h2>Waiting for the sound to be ready and using it.</h2>

As mentioned, you will have to call Sound::getOpenState to wait for the sound to load in the background.   You could do this, or just continually try to call the function you want to call (i.e. System::playSound) until it succeeds.<br>
Here is an example of polling the sound until it is ready, then playing it.<br>
<PRE>
FMOD_RESULT result;
FMOD::Sound *sound;
result = system->createStream("../media/wave.mp3", FMOD_NONBLOCKING, 0, &sound); <b>// Creates a handle to a stream then commands the FMOD Async loader to open the stream in the background.</b>
ERRCHECK(result);

do
{
	FMOD_OPENSTATE state;

	result = tmpsnd->getOpenState(&state, 0, 0);
	ERRCHECK(result);
	
	if (state == FMOD_OPENSTATE_READY && !channel)
	{
		result = system->playSound(FMOD_CHANNEL_FREE, sound, false, &channel);
		ERRCHECK(result);
	}

	GameCode();
} while (1)
</PRE>

or

<PRE>
do
{
	if (!channel)
	{
		result = system->playSound(FMOD_CHANNEL_FREE, sound, false, &channel);
		if (result != FMOD_ERR_NOTREADY)
		{
			ERRCHECK(result);
		}
	}

	GameCode();
} while (1)
</PRE>

The second loop will simply retry playsound until it succeeds.

<h2>Creating the sound as a streamed FSB file.</h2>
An FSB file will have subsounds in it, so if you open it as a stream, you may not want FMOD seeking to the first subsound and wasting time.  You can use the initialsubsound member of the FMOD_CREATESOUNDEXINFO structure to make the non-blocking open seek to the subsound of your choice.<br>
<PRE>
FMOD_RESULT result;
FMOD::Sound *sound;
FMOD_CREATESOUNDEXINFO exinfo;

memset(&exinfo, 0, sizeof(FMOD_CREATESOUNDEXINFO));
exinfo.cbsize = sizeof(FMOD_CREATESOUNDEXINFO);
exinfo.initialsubsound = 1;

result = system->createStream("../media/sounds.fsb", FMOD_NONBLOCKING, &exinfo, &sound);
ERRCHECK(result);
</PRE>
Then get the subsound you wanted with Sound::getSubSound.<br>

<h2>Getting a subsound.</h2>

Sound::getSubSound is a free function call normally, all it does is return a pointer to the subsound, whether it be a sample or a stream.  It does not execute any special code besides this.<br>
What it would cause if it was a blocking stream though, is System::playSound stalling several milliseconds or more while it seeks and reflushes the stream buffer.  Time taken can depend on the file format and media.<br>
<br>
If the parent sound was opened using FMOD_NONBLOCKING, then it will set the <b>subsound</b> to be FMOD_OPENSTATE_SEEKING and it will become not ready again until the seek and stream buffer flush has completed.<br>
When the stream is ready and System::playSound is called, then the playsound will not stall and will execute immediately because the stream has been flushed.<br>
