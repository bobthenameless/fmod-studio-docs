<h1>Granular Synthesis Example</h1>

<p>This example shows how you can play a string of sounds together without gaps,
using the setDelay command.</p>

<p>The basic operation is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Play 2 sounds initially at the same time, the first sound immediately, and
the 2nd sound with a delay calculated by the length of the first sound.</li>
<li>Call setDelay to initiate the delayed playback. setDelay is sample accurate
and uses -output- samples as the time frame, not source samples. These
samples are a fixed amount per second regardless of the source sound format,
for example, 48000 samples per second if FMOD is initialized to 48khz output.</li>
<li>Output samples are calculated from source samples with a simple
source->output sample rate conversion. i.e.
    sound_length *= output_rate
    sound_length /= sound_frequency</li>
<li>When the first sound finishes, the second one should have automatically
started. This is a good oppurtunity to queue up the next sound. Repeat
step 2.</li>
<li>Make sure the framerate is high enough to queue up a new sound before the
other one finishes otherwise you will get gaps.</li>
</ul>

<p>These sounds are not limited by format, channel count or bit depth like the 
realtimestitching example is, and can also be modified to allow for overlap,
by reducing the delay from the first sound playing to the second by the overlap
amount.</p>

<pre><code>#define USE_STREAMS = Use 2 stream instances, created while they play.
#define USE_STREAMS = Use 6 static wavs, all loaded into memory.
</code></pre>
