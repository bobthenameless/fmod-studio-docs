<h1>Play Stream Example</h1>

<p>This example shows how to simply play a stream such as an MP3 or WAV. The stream
behaviour is achieved by specifying <A HREF="../FMOD_MODE.html">FMOD_CREATESTREAM</A> in the call to 
<A HREF="../FMOD_System_CreateSound.html">System::createSound</A>. This makes FMOD decode the file in realtime as it plays,
instead of loading it all at once which uses far less memory in exchange for a
small runtime CPU hit.</p>

<h3>Location</h3>

<p>The example is located at api/lowlevel/examples/play_stream.cpp.</p>
