<h1>Effects Example</h1>

<p>This example shows how to apply some of the built in software effects to sounds
by applying them to the master channel group. All software sounds played here
would be filtered in the same way. To filter per channel, and not have other
channels affected, simply apply the same functions to the FMOD::Channel instead
of the FMOD::ChannelGroup.</p>

<p>Note in this example you don't have to add and remove units each time, you could
simply add them all at the start then use <A HREF="../FMOD_DSP_SetActive.html">DSP::setActive</A> to toggle them on and
off.</p>
