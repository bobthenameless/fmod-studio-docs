<h1>User Created Sound Example</h1>

<p>This example shows how create a sound with data filled by the user. It shows a
user created static sample, followed by a user created stream. The former
allocates all memory needed for the sound and is played back as a static sample, 
while the latter streams the data in chunks as it plays, using far less memory.</p>

<h3>Location</h3>

<p>The example is located at api/lowlevel/examples/user_created_sound.cpp.</p>
