<h1>Play Sound Example</h1>

<p>This example shows how to simply load and play multiple sounds, the simplest 
usage of FMOD. By default FMOD will decode the entire file into memory when it
loads. If the sounds are big and possibly take up a lot of RAM it would be
better to use the <A HREF="../FMOD_MODE.html">FMOD_CREATESTREAM</A> flag, this will stream the file in realtime
as it plays.</p>

<p>The example is located at api/lowlevel/examples/play_sound.cpp.</p>
