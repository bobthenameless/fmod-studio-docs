<h1>DSP Effect Per Speaker Example</h1>

<p>This example shows how to manipulate a DSP network and as an example, creates 2
DSP effects, splitting a single sound into 2 audio paths, which it then filters
seperately.</p>

<p>To only have each audio path come out of one speaker each,
<A HREF="../FMOD_DSPConnection_SetMixMatrix.html">DSPConnection::setMixMatrix</A> is used just before the 2 branches merge back together
again.</p>

<p>For more speakers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use <A HREF="../FMOD_System_SetSoftwareFormat.html">System::setSoftwareFormat</A></li>
<li>Create more effects, currently 2 for stereo (lowpass and highpass), create one
per speaker.</li>
<li>Under the 'Now connect the 2 effects to channeldsp head.' section, connect
the extra effects by duplicating the code more times.</li>
<li>Filter each effect to each speaker by calling <A HREF="../FMOD_DSPConnection_SetMixMatrix.html">DSPConnection::setMixMatrix</A>. <br>
Expand the existing code by extending the matrices from 2 in and 2 out, to the 
number of speakers you require.</li>
</ul>
