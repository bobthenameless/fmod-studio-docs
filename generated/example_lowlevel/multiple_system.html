<h1>Multiple System Example</h1>

<p>This example shows how to play sounds on two different output devices from the
same application. It creates two FMOD::System objects, selects a different sound
device for each, then allows the user to play one sound on each device.</p>

<p>Note that sounds created on device A cannot be played on device B and vice
versa.</p>

<h3>Location</h3>

<p>The example is located at api/lowlevel/examples/multiple_system.cpp.</p>
